# usually set to be characteristic of a proton-proton subprocess,
# on the order of ~ 1 TeV

# NOTE: fixing the scale misses out on some higher order effects
# Yes or No
FixedScale=Yes

# the energy cutoff reached before evolution stops (in Gev)
# this is the energy scale in which perturbative QCD stops being valid
# it can be slightly varied around this value, ideally it wouldn't go any lower,
# but can be set higher
